          This is the first entry in my blog. Depending on your definition, this
          might be my first entry in <em>any</em> blog. I absolutely love
          creating text-driven content, yet I've shy'd away from publishing
          compositions publicly. Here is to changing that narrative. Welcome to
          my first publication.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm in the process of building my portfolio site. I've learned how to
          work with technology in powerful ways, and I would like to create a
          home for my development content.
        </p>
        <p>
          So far, the tech stack I'm using here is as follows:
          <ul>
            <li>React with Next.JS</li>
            <li>TailwindCSS</li>
            <li>Typescript</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
